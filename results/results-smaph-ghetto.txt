 * Notes:
    * As expected, recall is quite higher, but not by much. Perhaps we could tune WAT for even
    more recall, since 0.765 is not all that much.
    * C2W precision dropped, but not as much as I (andrei) personally expected.
    * Nevertheless, we should experiment with stricter pruning in the SVM classifier.
    * But first, let's train on BOTH datasets (train A and train B).

# Results using basically the same implementation as above, but trained on both GERDAQ-A and B
